The scripts here are modified versions from https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/micropython/examples/pico_enviro/

`main.py` is a script that will get all measurements and every 60s send the data to an Adafruit.io account. It starts with the backlight off, but will turn it on every minute for a few seconds.
